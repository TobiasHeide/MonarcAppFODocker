Introduction
------------

Depending on its size and its security needs, organisations must react in the
most appropriate manner. Adopting good practices, taking the necessary measures
and adjusting them proportionally: all this is part of the process to ensure
information security. Most of all, it depends on performing a risk analysis on
a regular basis.

Although the profitability of the risk analysis approach is guaranteed, the
investment represented by this approach in terms of the required cost and
expertise is a barrier for many companies, especially SMEs.

To remedy this situation and allow all organisations, both large and small, to
benefit from the advantages that a risk analysis offers, CASES has developed an
optimised risk analysis method: [MONARC](https://www.monarc.lu)
(**Optimised Risk Analysis Method**), allowing precise and repeatable risk
management.

The advantage of MONARC lies in the capitalisation of risk analyses already
performed in similar business contexts: the same vulnerabilities regularly
appear in many businesses, as they face the same threats and generate similar
risks. Most companies have servers, printers, a fleet of smartphones, Wi-Fi
antennas, etc. therefore the vulnerabilities and threats
are the same. It is therefore sufficient to generalise risk scenarios for these
assets (also called objects) by context and/or business.

Documentation
-------------

You will find a user guide and a technical guide on the
[MONARC website](https://www.monarc.lu/documentation).

For installation instructions see
[INSTALL](https://www.monarc.lu/download/#source-code).

You can also use the provided [Virtual Machine](https://vm.monarc.lu).


Contributing
------------

If you are interested to contribute to the MONARC project, review our
[community page](https://www.monarc.lu/community).
There are many ways to contribute and participate to the project.

Feel free to fork the code, play with it, make some patches and send us the pull
requests.

There is one main branch: what we consider as stable with frequent updates as
hot-fixes.

Features are developed in separated branches and then regularly merged into the
master stable branch.

Please, do not open directly a GitHub issue if you think you have found a
security vulnerability. See our
[vulnerability disclosure](https://www.monarc.lu/community/vulnerability-disclosure/)
page.
